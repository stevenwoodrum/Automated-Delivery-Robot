Introduction to Electromechanical Systems course project.  Worked with Systems engineering student Matt Lowen and Mechanical engineering student Rich hardis.

Used a LAMP stack to issue commands from a web interface to a custom-built, Arduino-controlled, differential drive robot.

Personal responsibilities included: created web GUI, implemented a state machine to govern real-time navigation of a miniature road network, and wrote PHP scripts to communicate with an inventory database.
